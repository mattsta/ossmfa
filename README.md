# Open Source Software Maintainer Funding Agreement

do things. get paid.

## Funding Agreement Template

[Funding Agreement](./OSSMFA.md)

Feel free to use the Funding Agreement template either modified or directly for any sponsorship opportunities you're pursuing. Contributions for changes to language, terms, or alternative funding setups are also welcome.

The current agreement basically assumes you are an individual maintaining one or more reasonably popular open source projects and you are receiving funding from larger organizations to continue building and growing your open source project(s). You could potentially think of the OSSMFA as engaging in single-purpose self-directed contract work without any corporate oversight (also no benefits, insurance, passive employer option grant growth, etc). Your sponorship funding would be received under standard 1099 accounting, so essentially cut the funding number in half to adjust for taxes, then estimate what you're actually able to use for project continuation support and progress.

## Sample Rates

Three default funding tiers (season to taste):

- $250,000 USD per year funded 5-years up front
- $300,000 USD per year funded per year
- $90,000 USD per quarter funded per quarter


The benefit of longer funding commitments is lower up-front total rates for the duration of your funding term. Each future renewal has a growth rate attached so your professional services are not continually devalued due to inflation.
